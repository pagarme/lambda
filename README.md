## Intro

O propósito desse repo é centralizar tudo que discutirmos na guilda de programação funcional, desde material de estudos até discussões e datas de reuniões.

## Conceitos

- Imutabilidade
- Idempotência
- Efeitos Colaterais
- Expressividade

## Links

- [Cube Composer](http://david-peter.de/cube-composer/) - Puzzle que ensina *composição* e operações em lista como *map* e *filter*
- [la-ramda.js](https://gist.github.com/mrosata/0d54c552f297cf638bd719f7558478ac) - Um GIST implementando um subset de Ramda utilizando apenas arrow functions

## Libs

Algumas linguagens mais populares como JS, PHP e C# tem bastante suporte à programação funcional. libs dessa lista tem como objetivo entregar ferramentas para você extrair ao máximo os benefícios de funcional escondidos nelas.

### Multi-linguagem

* [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) - An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

### JS

* [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) - A practical functional library for JavaScript programmers.

### PHP

* [Garp Functional](https://github.com/grrr-amsterdam/garp-functional) - PHP utility library embracing functional programming paradigms. Supports PHP 5.3+.

## Recomendações de leitura

### Escrito por nós:

* [Sobre Javascript com funcional em mente](javascript.js)
* [Sobre Ramda](ramda.md)

### Grátis

* [**Mostly adequate guide to FP (in javascript)**](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)

`
This is a book on the functional paradigm in general. We'll use the world's most popular functional programming language: JavaScript.
`

* [**Functional Workaholism**](https://codepen.io/brekk/post/functional-workaholism)

`
Over the last year or so I've been learning functional programming (FP) and trying to fold it into my basic approach to software. I'd like to frame it here the way I'd teach it to someone who knows JS but doesn't know FP.
`

* [**Function composition with Handrails and Monads**](https://codepen.io/brekk/post/visual-function-composition)

`
In this article we're gonna talk about ways of visualizing functional composition and we're gonna introduce a simple Monad (don't worry, it's harmless!) that will make our composed functions safer in an easy-to-extend way.
`

* [**Learn you a Haskell**](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

`
Hey yo! This is Learn You a Haskell, the funkiest way to learn Haskell, which is the best functional programming language around. You may have heard of it. This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to try functional programming.
`

* [**Why Functional Programming Matters**](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

`
As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write and to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused to reduce future programming costs. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute significantly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). We conclude that since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional programming offers important advantages for software development.

### Pago

* [**Haskell Book**](http://haskellbook.com)

`
Welcome to a new way to learn Haskell. It is our goal to make Haskell as clear, painless, and practical as we can.
`

## Talks

### Funcional em geral

* [**Functional Programming Design Patterns**](https://vimeo.com/113588389)

`
In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID.
The functional programming community has design patterns and principles as well.
This talk will provide an overview of some of these, and present some demonstrations of FP design in practice.
